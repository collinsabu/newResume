                I recently expanded my skill set to include UI design using
                Figma, which complements my full stack development work. This
                ensures that the user interfaces I create are not only
                user-friendly but also visually appealing. I have built several
                projects showcasing my expertise in technologies like React,
                Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, which you can explore on my
                portfolio.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am now looking for opportunities to join a forward-thinking
                team where I can contribute my skills as a full stack developer.
                I am proficient in creating dynamic, responsive web applications
                using JavaScript, TypeScript, and modern frameworks like React
                and Next.js, alongside building robust backend solutions with
                Node.js, Express.js, and REST APIs. With hands-on experience in
                databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebase, and SuperBase, I
                excel in delivering end-to-end solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, my knowledge of DevOps tools like Docker, GitHub
                Actions for CI/CD, and deployment platforms like Vercel enables
                me to streamline the development process. If you are looking for
                someone who is dedicated, detail-oriented, and constantly
                striving to learn and improve, letâ€™s connect!
